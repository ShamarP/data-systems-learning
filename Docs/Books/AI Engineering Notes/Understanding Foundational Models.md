## What this chapter is about
In this chapter we go over the entire workflow of building foundational models. From how training data is acquired and used. Then it discusses how the models are built and what architectures are commonly used to build foundational models. After training the models there is a post training step that "validates" the output from the pre-trained model. This step is key for ensuring that the models output is safe for user consumption. It then finishes off with discussing the probabilistic nature of Foundational models and how this leads to hallucinations and how this affects AI products.
